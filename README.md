# React-JS
Q1.What is CDN?

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network

Q2.What is Cross Origin Attribute?

It is a security feature used in a Web development that allows or restricts scripts, stylesheets, images from different domains to interact with each other.

Q3.What is Babel?

Babel is Javascript transpiler that converts modern javascript code into a backward-compatible version that can run in older browsers.

Q4.What is Webpack?

Webpack is a module bundler for javascript applications.

Q5.Can you name some other bundlers?

Other bundlers are- Browserify, Rollup, Parcel and Fusebox.

Q6.What is Package.json and why is it important?

package.json is a configuration file in Node.js projects that contains metadata about the projects, such as dependencies, scripts. It is important because it helps in managing the project dependencies and automating common tasks.

Q7.What is NPM?

NPM stands for Node Package Manager.It is a package manager for Node.js projects that allows developers to install and manage third party packages.

Q8.What is GIT?

GIT is a verrsion control system used in a software development to manage code changes and collaborate with other developers.

Q9.What is Polyfill?

A polyfill is a peice of code that is commonly used to add support for new webAPIs and features to older browsers.

Q10.What is React?

It is a Javascript library for building user interfaces.

Q11.Why do we call React a Javascript Library?

Because it is a collection of prewritten javaScript code that developers can use to build user interfaces for web applications.

Q12.Why React is so fast?

Because React uses a virtual DOM to update the UI.

Q13.What are the scripting languages that we can use with React?

React is usually used with JavaScript, but it can also be used with other scripting languages like TypeScript and CoffeScript.

Q14.Can you explain the concept of SSR (Server Side Rendering) and how it can be used in improve SEO and page load times?

React Server-Side Rendering (SSR) involves rendering React components on the server-side and sending the fully-rendered HTML to the client. This approach improves SEO and initial page load times by allowing search engines to crawl and index the fully-rendered HTML content, and by reducing the time needed to download and parse JavaScript files on the client-side.

Q15.Difference between server side rendering and client side rendering

Server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) are two ways of rendering React components. SSR involves rendering React components on the server-side and sending the fully-rendered HTML to the client, while CSR involves rendering React components on the client-side browser using JavaScript. SSR is achieved by using Node.js to execute the JavaScript code and generate the HTML markup, which is sent to the client as a complete HTML page. This approach improves SEO and initial page load time, but can be slower for subsequent updates. CSR involves sending a minimal HTML page and a JavaScript bundle containing the React components and application logic to the client. The browser then downloads the bundle, executes it, and renders the components in the browser. This approach allows for greater interactivity and faster updates, but can be slower for the initial page load.

Q16.What is DOM (Document Object Model)?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. In other words, it creates a tree-like structure of the HTML document, allowing developers to manipulate the structure and content of the page through JavaScript. The DOM is used in web development to dynamically update the content of a web page without the need for a full page reload. JavaScript code can manipulate the DOM tree by adding, deleting, or modifying elements and attributes. This enables developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages that respond to user actions and input.

Q17.How does the DOM tree structure work, and how it is related to HTML, CSS and Javascript?

The DOM is a tree-like structure that represents the content of an HTML document, with each node representing an element, attribute, or text. HTML defines the basic structure, CSS styles the content, and JavaScript can manipulate the DOM to modify the content, style, or behavior of the page. The DOM tree is created when the HTML document is parsed by the browser.
